###**Briefly about myself:**

I finished my study in BNTU and got construction engineer specialization at 2015. I have started my career on public enterprise "Goravtomost" and I continue to work there. Through the position of manager I've got organization, analyst skills, and a lot of soft skills.
However, 10 month ago I was interested in programming basic and site construction. I began to learn this themes very active and finished few useful free programming courses.
I don't have the industry programming experience, but I try to make up for it with quality education and initiative. I understand that a self-education is very important part of my study. Also I have plans to get high IT-education in BSU.

###**My skills:**
1. HTML5, CSS3
2. JavaScript basics
3. GitLab, GitHub
4. Work with models in Figma
5. VScode

###**Code example:**

Ones and Zeros from Codewars:
Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

 `const binaryArrayToNumber = arr => parseInt(arr.join(''), 2);`
